so i am building a small project for them - they have a lot of machines and lab equipmenet . everytime an employee sued to come to use it , they use it then fill the register with the following details - s no. , instrument / equipment id, Date, Product Name /code , start time, scientist sign and date, endtime , scientist sign and date , Remarks . I have been given a project to digitilize this system completely for them . with few other features of being able to show completely analyics of ehuch machines waere used and by whom . and also they have to printable . its use be very seamliess for the scuenltist to use as well . I have never built an actuall application that will be used by an entore company so , i need help with the complete plan , underlining everyhting - srting from building to its production to compelte stabilizationa nd maintencance of this . what do you think about this ?



its only 30 peices of equipemet and product id will not be a drope down , it will ike an input for description , but pervious descrptions showul sappea as dropwown .cuncutrent users will be around 30 . max 50 .integration will be nessed, they have their own server .no regulatory requiremenst as of now . budget should be a lot . timeline in 1 month . i will be only perosn working on it .i am thinking react , python postgres sql , what say , does this make sense?






also some logic details that , define what admin can see and what normal employess can , the analyrics is part for admin. as for the looging say one user at 8 am in the mornign start session at 5:30 pm in the eveing pretty mch scheduling . defualt value be fcourse curren ttime but anyway they can out other time in the day also . then other users cannot book the machine after 5:30 since he hasn't ended the session yet .but can definiely see who else is using the machine at that time . and also about logging the completed user session , if th euser logeed that he used the equipment at 6:30-8:30 , another user cant put any intersecting time while loggin his session he has to get alert saying osme other user was using it then .also this website is going to be only ion a computer .
